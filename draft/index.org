* Emacs

- =M-r= move cursor top middle bottom
- =M-S-x (meta shift x)= filter m-x
- =C-x ESC ESC= repeat last command
- =C-x z= repeat
- =C-x C-u= upcase-region
- =M-\= delete-horizontal-space
- just-one-space, cycle-spacing
- =M-^= delete-indentation
- The command ‘delete-duplicate-lines’ searches the region for
identical lines, and removes all but one copy of each.  Normally it
keeps the first instance of each repeated line, but with a ‘C-u’ prefix
argument it keeps the last.  With a ‘C-u C-u’ prefix argument, it only
searches for adjacent identical lines.  This is a more efficient mode of
operation, useful when the lines have already been sorted.  With a ‘C-u
C-u C-u’ prefix argument, it retains repeated blank lines.
