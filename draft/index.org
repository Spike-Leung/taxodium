- The command ‘delete-duplicate-lines’ searches the region for
identical lines, and removes all but one copy of each.  Normally it
keeps the first instance of each repeated line, but with a ‘C-u’ prefix
argument it keeps the last.  With a ‘C-u C-u’ prefix argument, it only
searches for adjacent identical lines.  This is a more efficient mode of
operation, useful when the lines have already been sorted.  With a ‘C-u
C-u C-u’ prefix argument, it retains repeated blank lines.
